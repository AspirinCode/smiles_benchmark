# SMILES Suite

A SMILES validation suite for [ChemCore](https://crates.io/chemcore). It's based on [this presentation](https://www.slideshare.net/NextMoveSoftware/a-de-facto-standard-or-a-freeforall) and [the smilesreading repository](https://github.com/nextmovesoftware/smilesreading.git). For details, see [the article](https://depth-first.com/articles/2020/10/05/improving-the-quality-of-cheminformatics-data-with-a-smiles-validation-benchmark).
